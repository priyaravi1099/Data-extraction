       "['Fantastic dinner at Entrenous! Pre ordered a sweet crepe for dessert but we were too full!! Will definitely be back for more! Second time back at the restaurant and the food were as good as the first time. Didn’t wait too long for the crepes to be ready. My boyfriend and I especially love the escargot - the garlicky taste is to die for! Geraldine, the owner, is very friendly and made sure that our experience was awesome. Recommend everyone to try their crepes at least once! Authentic taste and good service . ordered savoury and sweet crepe . very delicious and fresh . creme brulee was the best i ever had . its not only the food thats authentic its the staff too . staff eas very transparent in telling upfront about the wait time due to high traffic .. inspite of the risk of loosing the customer.   Recommend this 100% We had a range of savoury and sweet crepes for dinner - both were delicious! The salted butter caramel is highly recommended and you can buy a bottle for home. Service was very friendly and attentive, even though it was peak Saturday dinner time. Ambience is very cosy - we had a great table outside with a view of Raffles Hotel - my sister remarked that it felt like we were in France! Check out their daily specials on the board. I had the chorizo and egg, and it was delicious! Service was lovely as well. A nice cosy space for a lunch escape. My go-to restaurant for crepes! Location is easily accessible too. Good for vegetarians and they\\'ve buckwheat options for all the crepes. Great for afternoon snack or scrumptious dinner. Have been regularly visiting Entre nous for years. Always enjoy the crepes here. Their home made salted caramel and butter sugar crepes are my favourites, simple yet satisfying. Very good service. Very good crepes. Very homely and cosy feeling. Definitely try Stephan\\'s Favourite from the sweet crepe section. This creperie is one of the best we have tried. The galettes are perfectly crispy on the edges and the crepes are soft and buttery.  We have tried lots of different crepe toppings and they have all been delicious! The escargots are also great - the garlic butter is never wasted and always mopped up with the bread roll that\\'s served with it. Our kids love coming here - one of their favourite dining places. Amazing tasts crepes. Loved them. Service was very friendly and helpful. Only criticism is the place could do with a bit of tlc. Bit tired in there and needing some  redecoration. My little child and I enjoyed the lunch of crepes and ice cream very much. Mushroom cheese was a healthy option for child. I super love the salted caramel ice cream too. Thank you Geraldine for being a wonderful host too. My first visit here and it was my friend the birthday girl who requested to come here for their crepes. So glad this place didn\\'t disappoint! Generous serving, fresh ingredients were used and staff were friendly! I requested for a birthday surprise and they were able to put a candle on our dessert crepe!   Nice and cosy place to come with family and friends! Will definitely return again! I can\\'t thank my friend enough for telling me about this restaurant.. they have the best crepes in Singapore! My favorites are the ham and cheese crepes and the nutella crepe for dessert.. there are so many others that i have tried with my family and i have enjoyed all :) this place is a must try! Tucked away in the high end Downtown / Marina district is a little slice of Brittany that is one of Singapore\\'s best eateries - Entre-Nous.  From the minute you walk in, the layout, decor and atmosphere is like a local bistro in France. It has that busy yet relaxed style that they are so well known for. Geraldine greets you with a warm smile and takes you to your table.  My dining partner is coeliac (strict gluten free) and getting gluten free food in Singapore can be a big challenge. Entre-Nous scores top marks here - Geraldine knew exactly what that was and reassured us that one of their specialities is the gluten free buckwheat crepes which could be done with pretty much all fillings. As they make their own sauces and dressings in house, they know that it is gluten free.  We ordered the classic French onion soup, two savoury crepes, a sweet crepe and two desserts along with glasses of apple cider imported from Brittany (we had the sweet variety which was a pure unfiltered and not too sweet cider with an encompassing rich apple flavour). Our drinks were served very promptly and soup quickly followed. The soup was superb with the natural sweetness of the onions combined with the flavoursome soup was delightful and reminded me of the soup my Belgian grandmother made - truly authentic. Another amazing reminder of home came via the salad which was simple lettuce with house made vinaigrette. A source of confusion for my dining parter who grew up eating salads that had to have a multitude of other vegetables in it, this was what I remembered having growing up and I hope they never change it. Tender sweet lettuce with a tangy vinaigrette is perfect to sharpen the tastebuds for the crepe course. Next was the savoury crepes and they were hands down the best I have had outside of France. Fresh and delicious fillings encased in an almost wafer thin crepe that would put many expensive \\'French\\' restaurants to shame. This was authentic French cooking at its finest - with a focus on the flavour and traditional cooking methods. No strange foams or clouds on tiny food but honest and delicious French cuisine. All the while and despite having a near full house, Geraldine ensured our table was looked after - plates promptly cleared, checking to see if we needed any more drinks and ensuring service ran smoothly. The creme brûlée for dessert was incredible. Framed beautifully by house made salted butter caramel (which I was almost tempted to forgo manners and lick the plate it was so good), the top had a satisfying crack followed by velvety smooth vanilla creme. After a few very poor dining experiences around Robertson Quay (some of which were quite a bit more expensive), this was the experience that blew them all away. This beautiful art of making exceptional food by using authentic house made ingredients, time honoured recipes and classic methods is what French cuisine is all about.  If you are in Singapore and deciding where to dine out, you owe it to yourself to go here. Because I think one visit and you\\'ll discover that Entre-Nous (which means \\'between us\\' in French) is the best authentic French dining experience Singapore has to offer. I must eat without gluten and Entre-Nous Creperie is a paradise! You can choose all savoury of the buckwheat flour galettes and there is no cross contamination so a very safe place for celiacs like me! I simply love this place! A real ‘galette’ freshly prepared with precautiously selected ingredients. Prefect reminder of Bretagne. The cidre doux is the cider everyone should try. It is really a nice place.  纯正的法国布列塔尼风情可丽饼 黑麦煎饼被黄油煎得酥脆 内馅也都是精心挑选的原料 每次来都让我想起圣马洛的海滩 店里的甜苹果酒一定要试 非常推荐的地方 Definitely a must-go address for crepe lovers or for those who want to taste a bit of Britany’s all time favourite.  This place has been one of our favourite family joint for many years. We go here when we want a treat. The gallettes are really delicious and very authentic and so is the cider! Highly recommended. Right in the center of Singapore, at a stone’s throw from Raffles Hotel; Entre-Nous’ galettes are very authentic, the service is excellent, and price reasonable - recommending to try both their salty and sweet galettes with their cider. Must try! The crepes are delicious and there is a large choice, I love the apple cider and the place is very nice and you can chose inside or outside Growing up in Brittany, I have eaten a lot of crêpes in my life. In all honesty, these are some of the best I have ever had. Clearly top quality ingredients and a the know-how of the chef. Highly recommended. Actually visited awhile back somewhere early April as a Singaporean couple, but didn\\'t have the time to pen down the experience.   We had the emmental cheese and button mushrooms with cream sauce, the ouessant, and the salted butter caramel crêpes, which were all really good. First of all, the booking was swift and efficient through facebook messenger. They quickly confirmed the booking and even had an option to pre-order the food so as they are very busy on Sunday morning.   I had the Entre-nous Crepe. It was a huge crepe. Wwnt to visit this cozy restaurant on Easter day as looking for something special for my family.  If you like tp enjoy something special and authentic crepes and I think this is the one for you. Overall, we enjoyed our meals 😊 I am a regular French customer of Entre-Nous crêperie which serves typical dishes from the Bretagne region. Recipes are both creative, original and authentic with high quality ingredients and drinks directly imported from France. I really enjoy bringing up all my local and/or non-French friends. Love the authenticity of the food. The parsley garlic butter escargot is a must try. Their specialty \"crepe\" does not disappoint at all. It is thin and crispy but comes with a generous serving of savoury fillings. The creme brulee and the homemade dark chocolate. Had the breizh menu for lunch and was super impressed by the generous serving of quality crepes, first served savoury then followed by sweet. Started with a nice salad and paired the meal with a really flavorful cider. Still can\\'t believe I don\\'t have to. We found this cute little place with a generous assortment of french galettes and pastries. Our server was very pleasant and the food did not disappoint! The escargot, prawn and avocado galette and salted caramel apple crepes are must tries. So happy to find gluten free French food in Singapore! We ordered the French Onion soup, escargot, Geraldine’s favourite (sweet crepe), and ham & cheese - everything was trés bon! Visited Entre-Nous over the weekend that served excellent sweet and savoury French crepes. Also tried the mushroom soup and escargots which were great. They also serve cocktails, beer and wine. Highly recommended! We frequent this place as it ticks all the boxes: amazing food, good service, good vibe and the right price point.  The crepes are all delicious and they are super accommodating about any preferences you might have. I love the roast chicken and sautéed onions.. Good quality ingredients, good buckwheat & overall flavour, & they have a good variety of options. Plus, the co-owner (Geraldine) is always friendly & welcoming. My favourite place for galattes & crepes in Singapore. I had the tomatoes and eggs buckwheat galette (gluten free) and for the sweet dessert I had the one with shaved coconut and maple syrup and coconut ice cream.   I have a gluten free and dairy free diet and they have options to accommodate those. My n-th time back and the food is consistently awesome as always! There is just something in the crepe batter that makes it so flavourful, and the crepes are always served fresh and crispy. I’ve tried a lot of other creperies including those popular on. Visited with my family including a preschooler and one  very picky two-year-old… everybody loved it! The crepes are freshly made, and the salted caramel cannot be missed. Merci beaucoup Geraldine and team! Lived here 9 years and this place has the best crepes in town!   It\\'s very hole-in-the-wall so while centrally-located it still felt like a hidden treasure. :)   Would 100% go again! Loving the taste of French food and everything else french, I was really excited when I first stumbled upon this nice little eaterie many years ago, and I always try to come back whenever I am around the area.   Owners and servers are French and. We absolutely adore this gorgeous authentic little creperie. Not able to nip to Paris … never mind! I can never quite decide what to order as I absolutely love the house made duck rillet but also want  a savoury crepe! If I’m lucky my friend. Highly recommended.  Entre-Nous Creperie is our go-to place for authentic galettes and crepes.  Great place for the entire family, including young children.  We\\'ve tried other creperies in Singapore and this is, by far, our favourite.  The savoury galettes are flavourful and delicious - the ingredients.

      "Fantastic dinner at Entrenous! Pre ordered a sweet crepe for dessert but we were too full!! Will definitely be back for more! Second time back at the restaurant and the food were as good as the first time. Didn’t wait too long for the crepes to be ready. My boyfriend and I especially love the escargot - the garlicky taste is to die for! Geraldine, the owner, is very friendly and made sure that our experience was awesome. Recommend everyone to try their crepes at least once! Authentic taste and good service . ordered savoury and sweet crepe . very delicious and fresh . creme brulee was the best i ever had . its not only the food thats authentic its the staff too . staff eas very transparent in telling upfront about the wait time due to high traffic .. inspite of the risk of loosing the customer.   Recommend this 100% We had a range of savoury and sweet crepes for dinner - both were delicious! The salted butter caramel is highly recommended and you can buy a bottle for home. Service was very friendly and attentive, even though it was peak Saturday dinner time. Ambience is very cosy - we had a great table outside with a view of Raffles Hotel - my sister remarked that it felt like we were in France! Check out their daily specials on the board. I had the chorizo and egg, and it was delicious! Service was lovely as well. A nice cosy space for a lunch escape. My go-to restaurant for crepes! Location is easily accessible too. Good for vegetarians and they've buckwheat options for all the crepes. Great for afternoon snack or scrumptious dinner. Have been regularly visiting Entre nous for years. Always enjoy the crepes here. Their home made salted caramel and butter sugar crepes are my favourites, simple yet satisfying. Very good service. Very good crepes. Very homely and cosy feeling. Definitely try Stephan's Favourite from the sweet crepe section. This creperie is one of the best we have tried. The galettes are perfectly crispy on the edges and the crepes are soft and buttery.  We have tried lots of different crepe toppings and they have all been delicious! The escargots are also great - the garlic butter is never wasted and always mopped up with the bread roll that's served with it. Our kids love coming here - one of their favourite dining places. Amazing tasts crepes. Loved them. Service was very friendly and helpful. Only criticism is the place could do with a bit of tlc. Bit tired in there and needing some  redecoration. My little child and I enjoyed the lunch of crepes and ice cream very much. Mushroom cheese was a healthy option for child. I super love the salted caramel ice cream too. Thank you Geraldine for being a wonderful host too. My first visit here and it was my friend the birthday girl who requested to come here for their crepes. So glad this place didn't disappoint! Generous serving, fresh ingredients were used and staff were friendly! I requested for a birthday surprise and they were able to put a candle on our dessert crepe!   Nice and cosy place to come with family and friends! Will definitely return again! I can't thank my friend enough for telling me about this restaurant.. they have the best crepes in Singapore! My favorites are the ham and cheese crepes and the nutella crepe for dessert.. there are so many others that i have tried with my family and i have enjoyed all :) this place is a must try! Tucked away in the high end Downtown / Marina district is a little slice of Brittany that is one of Singapore's best eateries - Entre-Nous.  From the minute you walk in, the layout, decor and atmosphere is like a local bistro in France. It has that busy yet relaxed style that they are so well known for. Geraldine greets you with a warm smile and takes you to your table.  My dining partner is coeliac (strict gluten free) and getting gluten free food in Singapore can be a big challenge. Entre-Nous scores top marks here - Geraldine knew exactly what that was and reassured us that one of their specialities is the gluten free buckwheat crepes which could be done with pretty much all fillings. As they make their own sauces and dressings in house, they know that it is gluten free.  We ordered the classic French onion soup, two savoury crepes, a sweet crepe and two desserts along with glasses of apple cider imported from Brittany (we had the sweet variety which was a pure unfiltered and not too sweet cider with an encompassing rich apple flavour). Our drinks were served very promptly and soup quickly followed. The soup was superb with the natural sweetness of the onions combined with the flavoursome soup was delightful and reminded me of the soup my Belgian grandmother made - truly authentic. Another amazing reminder of home came via the salad which was simple lettuce with house made vinaigrette. A source of confusion for my dining parter who grew up eating salads that had to have a multitude of other vegetables in it, this was what I remembered having growing up and I hope they never change it. Tender sweet lettuce with a tangy vinaigrette is perfect to sharpen the tastebuds for the crepe course. Next was the savoury crepes and they were hands down the best I have had outside of France. Fresh and delicious fillings encased in an almost wafer thin crepe that would put many expensive 'French' restaurants to shame. This was authentic French cooking at its finest - with a focus on the flavour and traditional cooking methods. No strange foams or clouds on tiny food but honest and delicious French cuisine. All the while and despite having a near full house, Geraldine ensured our table was looked after - plates promptly cleared, checking to see if we needed any more drinks and ensuring service ran smoothly. The creme brûlée for dessert was incredible. Framed beautifully by house made salted butter caramel (which I was almost tempted to forgo manners and lick the plate it was so good), the top had a satisfying crack followed by velvety smooth vanilla creme. After a few very poor dining experiences around Robertson Quay (some of which were quite a bit more expensive), this was the experience that blew them all away. This beautiful art of making exceptional food by using authentic house made ingredients, time honoured recipes and classic methods is what French cuisine is all about.  If you are in Singapore and deciding where to dine out, you owe it to yourself to go here. Because I think one visit and you'll discover that Entre-Nous (which means 'between us' in French) is the best authentic French dining experience Singapore has to offer. I must eat without gluten and Entre-Nous Creperie is a paradise! You can choose all savoury of the buckwheat flour galettes and there is no cross contamination so a very safe place for celiacs like me! I simply love this place! A real ‘galette’ freshly prepared with precautiously selected ingredients. Prefect reminder of Bretagne. The cidre doux is the cider everyone should try. It is really a nice place.  纯正的法国布列塔尼风情可丽饼 黑麦煎饼被黄油煎得酥脆 内馅也都是精心挑选的原料 每次来都让我想起圣马洛的海滩 店里的甜苹果酒一定要试 非常推荐的地方 Definitely a must-go address for crepe lovers or for those who want to taste a bit of Britany’s all time favourite.  This place has been one of our favourite family joint for many years. We go here when we want a treat. The gallettes are really delicious and very authentic and so is the cider! Highly recommended. Right in the center of Singapore, at a stone’s throw from Raffles Hotel; Entre-Nous’ galettes are very authentic, the service is excellent, and price reasonable - recommending to try both their salty and sweet galettes with their cider. Must try! The crepes are delicious and there is a large choice, I love the apple cider and the place is very nice and you can chose inside or outside Growing up in Brittany, I have eaten a lot of crêpes in my life. In all honesty, these are some of the best I have ever had. Clearly top quality ingredients and a the know-how of the chef. Highly recommended. Actually visited awhile back somewhere early April as a Singaporean couple, but didn't have the time to pen down the experience.   We had the emmental cheese and button mushrooms with cream sauce, the ouessant, and the salted butter caramel crêpes, which were all really good. First of all, the booking was swift and efficient through facebook messenger. They quickly confirmed the booking and even had an option to pre-order the food so as they are very busy on Sunday morning.   I had the Entre-nous Crepe. It was a huge crepe. Wwnt to visit this cozy restaurant on Easter day as looking for something special for my family.  If you like tp enjoy something special and authentic crepes and I think this is the one for you. Overall, we enjoyed our meals 😊 I am a regular French customer of Entre-Nous crêperie which serves typical dishes from the Bretagne region. Recipes are both creative, original and authentic with high quality ingredients and drinks directly imported from France. I really enjoy bringing up all my local and/or non-French friends. Love the authenticity of the food. The parsley garlic butter escargot is a must try. Their specialty \"crepe\" does not disappoint at all. It is thin and crispy but comes with a generous serving of savoury fillings. The creme brulee and the homemade dark chocolate. Had the breizh menu for lunch and was super impressed by the generous serving of quality crepes, first served savoury then followed by sweet. Started with a nice salad and paired the meal with a really flavorful cider. Still can't believe I don't have to. We found this cute little place with a generous assortment of french galettes and pastries. Our server was very pleasant and the food did not disappoint! The escargot, prawn and avocado galette and salted caramel apple crepes are must tries. So happy to find gluten free French food in Singapore! We ordered the French Onion soup, escargot, Geraldine’s favourite (sweet crepe), and ham & cheese - everything was trés bon! Visited Entre-Nous over the weekend that served excellent sweet and savoury French crepes. Also tried the mushroom soup and escargots which were great. They also serve cocktails, beer and wine. Highly recommended! We frequent this place as it ticks all the boxes: amazing food, good service, good vibe and the right price point.  The crepes are all delicious and they are super accommodating about any preferences you might have. I love the roast chicken and sautéed onions.. Good quality ingredients, good buckwheat & overall flavour, & they have a good variety of options. Plus, the co-owner (Geraldine) is always friendly & welcoming. My favourite place for galattes & crepes in Singapore. I had the tomatoes and eggs buckwheat galette (gluten free) and for the sweet dessert I had the one with shaved coconut and maple syrup and coconut ice cream.   I have a gluten free and dairy free diet and they have options to accommodate those. My n-th time back and the food is consistently awesome as always! There is just something in the crepe batter that makes it so flavourful, and the crepes are always served fresh and crispy. I’ve tried a lot of other creperies including those popular on. Visited with my family including a preschooler and one  very picky two-year-old… everybody loved it! The crepes are freshly made, and the salted caramel cannot be missed. Merci beaucoup Geraldine and team! Lived here 9 years and this place has the best crepes in town!   It's very hole-in-the-wall so while centrally-located it still felt like a hidden treasure. :)   Would 100% go again! Loving the taste of French food and everything else french, I was really excited when I first stumbled upon this nice little eaterie many years ago, and I always try to come back whenever I am around the area.   Owners and servers are French and. We absolutely adore this gorgeous authentic little creperie. Not able to nip to Paris … never mind! I can never quite decide what to order as I absolutely love the house made duck rillet but also want  a savoury crepe! If I’m lucky my friend. Highly recommended.  Entre-Nous Creperie is our go-to place for authentic galettes and crepes.  Great place for the entire family, including young children.

I live around the corner and I have been more than once, both on dates and alone. The couple is nice and the lady hosts and serves -very pleasant and helpful. I don't know a real crepe, and whether it should be crispy, but I. authentic creps should not be crispy. Interesting combi of ingredients which taste good\n"
